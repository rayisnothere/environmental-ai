# Environmental AI (Air, Water, Soil)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that predicts Air Quality (AQI), Water Quality (WQI), and Soil Quality using small sample datasets. 

**Features:**
- Random Forest models for each environmental category
- Self-contained CSV data embedded in the code
- Graphs of predicted vs actual values

**Limitations:**
- Sample datasets only (7 rows each)
- Not suitable for real-world prediction
- For learning and demonstration purposes

**How to run:**
1. Install Python and VS Code
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`
3. Run: `python environmental_ai.py`
have a good day
